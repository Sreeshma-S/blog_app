Django Developer Practical Test
Objective:
Develop a simple blog application with user authentication, Use Django Rest Framework for CRUD operations for blog posts, and API for managing blog posts.
Requirements:
1.User Authentication:

• Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete their own blog posts.

2.Blog Post Management:
• Implement CRUD operations for blog posts (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
• Each blog post should have a title, content, author (linked to user), and a timestamp.

3.API for Blog Posts:
• Create a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework for managing blog posts.
• The API should allow for listing all posts, retrieving a single post, creating a new post, updating a post, and deleting a post.
• Bonus: Create a post scheduler. So that the posts can be automatically published in scheduled date and time

4.User Interface:
• Create templates for listing all blog posts, viewing a single post, and forms for creating/editing posts.
• Use Bootstrap for basic styling.

5.Bonus: Testing:
• Write unit tests for the views and API endpoints.

Deliverables:
• A GitHub repository with the complete project.
• A README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.
• Basic unit tests for the views and API endpoints.
